# Machine-Learning-Enhancements-in-PSM-Analysis


*For this repo we will be working to replicate "The BeneÔ¨Åts of College Athletic Success: An Application of the Propensity Score Design" and then work to apply new Machine Learning techniques to improve upon the paper's model.

*For the current stage of the project we are planning to leverage the existing database we have access to as well as the paper itself to take into google colab form. After this we plan to work in several different areas to better maximize the efficiency of the group. By this, we are planning on going into nonnumeric data (searching text for key words relating to the studies focus), adding more years of data into the study, and working to apply Random Forests as a method to improve upon the PSM matching to find better matches reducing the endogeneity of the model and better identifying the Causal Impact.

*The Machine Learning component isn't entirely known to us at this time and while we know we are going to pursue Random Forests we are unsure of if we plan to extend it beyond this into different sub branches.
