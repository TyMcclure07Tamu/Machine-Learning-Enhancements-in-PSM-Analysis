# Machine-Learning-Enhancements-in-PSM-Analysis

* For this repo we will be working to replicate "The BeneÔ¨Åts of College Athletic Success: An Application of the Propensity Score Design" and then work to apply new Machine Learning techniques to improve upon the paper's model.

* By this, we are planning on going into nonnumeric data (searching text for key words relating to the studies focus), adding more years of data into the study, and working to apply Random Forests as a method to improve upon the PSM matching to find better matches reducing the endogeneity of the model thus better identifying the Causal Impact.
* We plan to use the random forrests to compare to the PSM scores generated in the paper itself to see if we have reduced some varaince in the underlying paper itself.
